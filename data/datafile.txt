Game savefile format, binaryish
The string format is kind of dumb; personally I just wanted to have the size first,
followed by the string, but then I wanted to patch my local magic(4) file to
recognize 'em, which will only really process NULL-terminated strings, so I put in
the NULL byte as well.  C'est la vie.

Datatypes:

# int4
% short (int2)
$ string, int2 size followed by the actual string (null terminated, size does not include the NULL)
& char (unsigned)
| char bitfield

The file:

ADVMAP (first six bytes, identifier)
% Savefile version number (1)
$ Game Name
% Number of Maps

Then groups of Maps, for each map:
  $ Map Name
  & Width
  & Height
  % Number of active rooms

  Followed by groups of rooms, for each room:
    % Map idx
    & x
    & y
    $ Room Name
    & Room type (0: Normal, 1: Entrance, 2: Label)
    $ up
    $ down
    $ Notes
    | connections (MSB: N, LSB: NW, going clockwise)
    Nx% connection ID, starting with N...  Could be no bytes for an
        unconnected room
