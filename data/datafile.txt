Game savefile format, binaryish
The string format is kind of dumb; personally I just wanted to have the size first,
followed by the string, but then I wanted to patch my local magic(4) file to
recognize 'em, which will only really process NULL-terminated strings, so I put in
the NULL byte as well.  C'est la vie.

Datatypes:

# int4
% short (int2)
$ string, int2 size followed by the actual string (null terminated, size does not include the NULL)
& char (unsigned)
| char bitfield

The file:

ADVMAP (first six bytes, identifier)
% Savefile version number (1)
$ Game Name
% Number of Maps

Then groups of Maps, for each map:
  $ Map Name
  & Width
  & Height
  % Number of active rooms
  % Number of links between rooms

  Followed by groups of rooms, for each room:
    % Room ID
    & x
    & y
    $ Room Name
    & Room type
        0: Normal
        1: Green Highlight
        2: Label
        3: Blue Highlight
        4: Red Highlight
        5: Faint
    $ up
    $ down
    $ Notes
    | flags:
        00000001 = y is offset
        00000010 = x is offset

  Followed by groups of Links, for each link:
    % Room 1 ID
    & Room 1 Direction
    % Room 2 ID
    & Room 2 Direction
