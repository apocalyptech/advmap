RFEs:
 * write whole group out to PNG
 * Should we still be able to edit Notes in readonly mode?
 * shift-click from main screen to group

GUI stuffs:
 * Can trigger some unpack warnings by hovering around the lower-right-hand
   corner of the map
 * Three-line title will overlap "(notes)" on my Laptop display
 * Different ways to draw nonsymmetric links (thinking "rounded" and
   "midpoint" at the least)
 * Show "(notes)" on map for Label rooms
 * Mouseover hover notes text, when available
 * Should really draw some little icons for mouseovers, instead of just
   highlighting in green
 * Can connect indirectly on the side of the map, which looks a bit
   strange; should figure out how to make that look better, or just disallow
   it.
 * Have a separate set of "activated" icons for our toggleable buttons
 * Manage room grouping via hotkey in main window

Internal stuffs:
 * Have a flag to draw_room() which lets us only re-draw the mousemap
 * Put in a cache surface to draw to, after all - forwarding this over X is
   pretty slow

Possibly, sometime:
 * redo internal storage mechanisms/mousemaps to allow > 256 rooms
 * multiple links from the same direction
 * option double-sized rooms
