RFEs:
 * write whole group out to PNG
 * Should we still be able to edit Notes in readonly mode?

GUI stuffs:
 * Can trigger some unpack warnings by hovering around the lower-right-hand
   corner of the map
 * Three-line title will overlap "(notes)" on my Laptop display
 * Different ways to draw nonsymmetric links (thinking "rounded" and
   "midpoint" at the least)
 * Show "(notes)" on map for Label rooms
 * Mouseover hover notes text, when available
 * Should really draw some little icons for mouseovers, instead of just
   highlighting in green
 * Can connect indirectly on the side of the map, which looks a bit
   strange; should figure out how to make that look better, or just disallow
   it.
 * Have a separate set of "activated" icons for our toggleable buttons
 * Undo/Redo would be real nice
 * Copy/Paste would be nice, too.
 * Popup when LMB on a connection to edit conn attributes (should be much
   more manageable than our previous Advanced tab on Room Edit)
 * Better one-way arrows for ladder connections.  What we do right now
   is technically Good Enough, but it doesn't really look great.

Internal stuffs:
 * Have a flag to draw_room() which lets us only re-draw the mousemap
 * Put in a cache surface to draw to, after all - forwarding this over X is
   pretty slow

Possibly, sometime:
 * redo internal storage mechanisms/mousemaps to allow > 256 rooms
 * multiple links from the same direction
   -> Have that partially, now - can have multiple ends on the same room,
      at least.
 * double-sized rooms

PyQt porting issues which I've temporarily set aside:
 * Rich text in dropddowns + checkboxes (both in Edit Room dialog)
 * Dashed lines don't render well when the mainarea is being scrolled.
   They fix easily enough when we hit our hover events and things get
   redrawn, but that wouldn't help longer dashed connections
 * Handing app arguments properly
 * Get a set of standard icons for us to use rather than relying on
   toolkit.
 * Icons on dialog buttons
 * MessageDialog width - force it to be at least a certain width somehow.
 * Prevent dragging rooms to different columns; what the hell?
 * Window titles for our QMessageDialogs
