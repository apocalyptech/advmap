RFEs:
 * write out to PNG (crop appropriately)
 * write whole group out to PNG
 * "readonly" mode, or maybe at least disable room edits

GUI stuffs:
 * set_sensitive(False) for global nudge buttons when not available
 * Show "(notes)" on map for Label rooms
 * Ampersands in text (room names, etc) fail because it's attempting to
   be markup, should fix that
 * Mouseover hover notes text, when available
 * Should really draw some little icons for mouseovers, instead of just
   highlighting in green

Internal stuffs:
 * Have a flag to draw_room() which lets us only re-draw the mousemap
 * Put in a cache surface to draw to, after all - forwarding this over X is
   pretty slow

Possibly, sometime:
 * redo internal storage mechanisms/mousemaps to allow > 256 rooms
 * Arbitrary room coloring / highlighting
 * one-way linking
 * multiple links from the same direction
 * option double-sized rooms
 * easier/more intuitive handling of up/down (specifically would like to
   have an option to "replace" N/S with up/down, on a room-by-room basis
   See the Planetfall map, etc.

that are basically impossible with this tool...  Zork 1 basically just
Doesn't Work, AMFV is way too big
