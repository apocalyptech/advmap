Things I'm not sure of:
 * Should we still be able to edit Notes in readonly mode?

Stuff I'd definitely like to do at some point, time permitting:
 * write whole group out to PNG
 * Three-line title will overlap "(notes)" on my Laptop display
 * Different ways to draw nonsymmetric links (thinking "rounded" and
   "midpoint" at the least)
 * Show "(notes)" on map for Label rooms
 * Expand our room mouseovers - should be able to summarize most of the
   info in there, I'd think.
 * Should really draw some little icons for mouseovers, instead of just
   highlighting in green
 * Undo/Redo would be real nice
 * Copy/Paste would be nice, too.
 * Popup when LMB on a connection to edit conn attributes (should be much
   more manageable than our previous Advanced tab on Room Edit)
 * Better one-way arrows for ladder connections.  What we do right now
   is technically Good Enough, but it doesn't really look great.
 * Dashed lines don't render well when the mainarea is being scrolled.
   They fix easily enough when we hit our hover events and things get
   redrawn, but that wouldn't help longer dashed connections.  I've
   verified that this is a bug which seems to affect other people as
   well, and have put it in as a bug in their tracker:
   https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-63322
 * Put icons on dialog buttons
 * our MapCombo looks like it's probably getting squished, causing
   unnecessary truncation in some cases

Possibly, sometime:
 * multiple links from the same direction
   -> Have that partially, now - can have multiple ends on the same room,
      at least.
 * double-sized rooms, or even arbitrarily-large room.  Sort of a
   super-group where the room itself takes over space instead of just
   the background notification
