RFEs:
 * write out to PNG (crop appropriately)
 * write whole group out to PNG

GUI stuffs:
 * set_sensitive(False) for global nudge buttons when not available
 * Show "(notes)" on map for Label rooms
 * Ampersands in text (room names, etc) fail because it's attempting to
   be markup, should fix that
 * Mouseover hover notes text, when available

Internal stuffs:
 * Have a flag to draw_room() which lets us only re-draw the mousemap
 * Put in a cache surface to draw to, after all - forwarding this over X is
   pretty slow

Possibly, sometime:
 * non-immediately-adjacent linking (across gaps, etc)
 * non-symmetrical linking
 * multiple links from the same direction
