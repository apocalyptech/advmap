This is an experimental mapping program for adventure games, such as the old
Sierra adventures, and interactive fiction (such as from Infocom, etc).

It's got some good points and bad points; a lot of it's a little bizarre,
though it worked well enough for my purposes while I was going on a huge
adventure game binge a number of years ago.

The file format itself is currently all binary -- I struggled for awhile with
the knowledge that really I should be using some kind of gzipped XML format
rather than binary, but I have something of a grudge against XML and tend to
avoid it whenever possible.

Anyawy, inside "res" there's a bunch of sample ones that I had created and
played around with.  Perhaps this'll be of use to someone.  It's written in
Python; should work on anything you can get PyGTK/PyCairo to work on.

I have some vague interest in cleaning this up and maybe making it into
something a little more public-ready; we'll see if that happens at all.
